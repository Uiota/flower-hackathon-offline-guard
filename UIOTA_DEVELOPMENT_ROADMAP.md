# UIOTA Development Roadmap
## Phase-by-Phase Implementation Strategy for Sovereign AI Framework

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: September 11, 2025  
**Timeline**: 16-week implementation plan  
**Foundation**: Building on existing offline-guard infrastructure

---

## üéØ ROADMAP OVERVIEW

The UIOTA Framework development follows a structured 4-phase approach that builds incrementally on the existing offline-guard foundation. Each phase delivers working functionality while preparing for the next level of capability.

**Development Phases**:
1. **Foundation Completion** (Weeks 1-4): Complete missing components and basic integration
2. **Core UIOTA Services** (Weeks 5-8): Implement sovereign AI capabilities
3. **Advanced Features** (Weeks 9-12): Deploy security, optimization, and scaling
4. **Ecosystem Expansion** (Weeks 13-16): Community features and market readiness

**Success Criteria**:
- Each phase delivers working functionality
- Guardian system integration throughout
- Existing infrastructure remains operational
- Flower AI hackathon readiness maintained
