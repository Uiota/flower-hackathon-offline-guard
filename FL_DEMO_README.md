host = "localhost"
port = 8888

# Simulation parameters
max_clients = 12
training_rounds = 500
initial_accuracy = 85.0
```

### Dashboard Customization
```javascript
// Animation settings
const ANIMATION_DURATION = 1000;
const PARTICLE_COUNT = 20;
const UPDATE_INTERVAL = 3000;

// Visual preferences
const THEME_PRIMARY = "#10a37f";
const THEME_SECONDARY = "#1a73e8";
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port Already in Use**: Change port with `--port` flag
2. **Browser Not Opening**: Manually navigate to http://localhost:8888
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Use simple launcher or install requirements
4. **Performance Issues**: Reduce animation settings or particle count

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
python3 simple_demo_launcher.py --port 8888 --debug

# Check system status
curl http://localhost:8888/api/status
```
