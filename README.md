# Offline Guard

Proof-of-concept for sovereign offline communication networks.

## Project Structure
- `android/` - Android app for offline detection and QR generation
- `verifier/` - Ghost device code (Pi/ESP32) for verification
- `nft-cartoon/` - Guardians of Decentralized AI NFT artwork and storylines
- `backend/` - Optional API and dashboard
- `docs/` - Documentation and specifications
- `scripts/` - Build and deployment scripts
- `demos/` - Demo scenarios and test data

## The Guardian Connection
This project is the first technical building block of the **Guardians of Decentralized AI** universe - where real heroes building alternatives to centralized AI control get their own superhero avatars. Our "Offline Guard" enables the digital sovereignty that the Guardians fight to protect.

## Roadmap
1. **Proof** (Current) - Offline state verification + Guardian character evolution
2. **Sync** - Device-to-device QR communication + Guardian team formation
3. **Mesh** - Multi-device relay networks + Guardian federation
4. **Ledger** - Sovereign distributed consensus + Guardian governance

## Dev Team Recognition
Every contributor to this project will get their own Guardian character NFT reflecting their technical specialties and contributions to digital sovereignty.
