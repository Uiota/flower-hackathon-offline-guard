# UIOTA Security Model & Threat Assessment
## Comprehensive Security Architecture for Sovereign AI Systems

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: September 11, 2025  
**Classification**: Guardian-Protected Information  
**Foundation**: Building on existing `/containers/kubernetes/production-security.yaml`

---

## üõ°Ô∏è EXECUTIVE SECURITY SUMMARY

The UIOTA Framework implements a defense-in-depth security model centered around Guardian-based identity and access management. This approach ensures that sovereign AI systems remain under user control while providing robust protection against nation-state surveillance, corporate data harvesting, and AI model attacks.

**Core Security Principles**:
1. **Guardian-Centric Authentication**: All access controlled by Guardian identity
2. **Offline-First Privacy**: Local data processing minimizes exposure
3. **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Verify every request and interaction
4. **Federated Security**: Distributed threat detection and response
5. **Cryptographic Sovereignty**: Guardian-controlled keys and signatures

**Current Security Foundation** (from existing infrastructure):
- ‚úÖ **TLS Termination**: Let's Encrypt certificates with auto-renewal
- ‚úÖ **Network Security**: NetworkPolicies and ingress controls
- ‚úÖ **Monitoring**: Prometheus alerting and security dashboards  
- ‚úÖ **Container Security**: PodSecurityPolicies and RBAC
- ‚úÖ **WAF Protection**: ModSecurity rules and rate limiting
