## 📱 **Android Project Sample**

### **MainActivity.kt Preview:**
```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var guardianManager: GuardianManager
    private lateinit var networkMonitor: NetworkMonitorService
    
    private fun activateOfflineMode() {
        offlineGuard.startOfflineMode()
        Toast.makeText(this, "🛡️ Offline Guard Activated!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        
        // Update Guardian
        guardianManager.recordOfflineEvent()
    }
    
    private fun generateOfflineProof() {
        val proof = offlineGuard.generateOfflineProof()
        showQRCode(proof.qrCodeData)
        Toast.makeText(this, "✅ Offline proof generated!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
}
```

**What This Gives You:**
- Real Android code structure
- Guardian character integration  
- QR proof generation
- Network monitoring
- Ready for APK compilation

## 🎭 **Order Storyline Integration Sample**

### **Narrative Overlay (Optional)**

**When Enabled:**
```javascript
// Device goes offline
onOfflineDetected() {
    if (storylineEnabled) {
        showOrderSequence("awakening");
        displayArchitectMessage("Ancient protocols stir within your device...");
    }
    // Technical functionality continues normally
}

// QR Proof generated  
onProofGenerated() {
    if (storylineEnabled) {
        showOrderSequence("proof");
        displayVerifierMessage("The Order recognizes your sovereignty...");
    }
    // Technical proof generation works regardless
}
```

**Visual Result:**
- Screen darkens with mystical overlay
- Guardian character glows with ethereal effects
- Technical information enhanced with thematic context
- Can be disabled instantly for pure technical demo

## 🌸 **Flower AI Integration Sample**

### **Guardian FL Client Demo:**

```python
# Guardian-powered Federated Learning
class GuardianFLClient(fl.client.NumPyClient):
    def __init__(self, guardian_id="CryptoGuard-001"):
        self.guardian_id = guardian_id
        self.offline_capable = True
        
    def fit(self, parameters, config):
        # Train while offline
        print(f"🛡️ Guardian {self.guardian_id} training offline...")
        
        # Simulate Guardian evolution during training
        if training_successful:
            self.evolve_guardian()
            
        return updated_parameters
        
    def evolve_guardian(self):
        print(f"⬆️ Guardian {self.guardian_id} evolved! New abilities unlocked.")
```

**What Judges See:**
