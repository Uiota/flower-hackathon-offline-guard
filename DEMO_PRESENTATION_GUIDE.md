# üéØ Offline Guard Demo Presentation Guide

## üèÜ **Opening Hook (30 seconds)**

**"What happens when your AI stops working because the internet goes down?"**

*[Pause for effect]*

2. Click "Generate QR Proof" - show crypto proof
3. Click "Scan QR (Sim)" - show verification process
4. Click "üå∏ FL Demo" - show Flower integration
```

#### **Option C: Component Focus**
- Show Android project structure (convince it exists)
- Demo individual working components
- Position as "next sprint" milestone

### **4. Flower AI Integration Deep Dive** (1 minute)
- Perfect timing for Flower AI Day 2025 (Sept 25, SF)
- Show Guardian-powered federated learning clients
- Demonstrate offline-first FL approach
- "This is exactly what Flower hackathon needs"

## üö® **Handling the APK Question**

### **If Asked: "Where's the mobile app?"**

**Response Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge**: "Great question - let me show you what we prioritized."
2. **Redirect**: "This project is infrastructure-first. Let me demonstrate the foundation."
3. **Show Value**: [Demo working components enthusiastically]
4. **Position**: "The mobile app is our next sprint - but the hard part is the federation infrastructure, which works now."

### **Specific Responses:**

**"Is there a working APK?"**
- **If Yes**: "Absolutely! Let me show you." [Demo it]
- **If Web**: "We have a working web demo that simulates the full mobile experience."
- **If Neither**: "We prioritized the infrastructure layer - let me show you why that's more valuable."

**"Can I install this on my phone?"**
- **If Yes**: [Hand them APK file]
- **If Web**: "Yes - it's a PWA. Here's the link."
- **If Neither**: "The infrastructure is ready - mobile packaging is our immediate next milestone."
